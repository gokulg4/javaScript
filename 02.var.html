            //var: variable is nothing but to store the values

            //How to declare a variable in js:
            var obj

            //what all types of values can be stored in a variable (var)
            var objA = "text"                   //string (it’s a normal text value)
            var objB = Object('hello', 'world') //before to ES6, an object needs to be declared as this
            var objC = 1234                     //number type
            var objD = { 'hello' : 'world' }    //an object data type containing string
            var objE = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]           //an array data type holding integers

            //understanding console.log();
            var myName = 'india';
            console.log(myName);

            //+ operator in JS in used for concatenation operation
            var myName = 'hello';
            console.log("My name is: " + myName);

           //when to use double and single quotes in JS
           //if single quotes were used in the above line the single will end before s
           var myName = 'chennai';
           console.log("what's your name: " + myName);

           //the single quotes issue can be bypassed using the escape char \
           console.log('what\'s your name: ' + myName);

           //understanding error’s that are raised in the console
           //the variable someVariable is not declared any where in the document
           //*** this line is commented to prevent the error ***
           // console.log(someVariable);

           //lets create reference for a variable using var
           //now the error in the console states - undefined
           //the meaning is there is reference for the variable but value is not defined for the variable
           var someVariables;
           console.log(someVariables);

           //scenario2: for undefined error
           console.log(someVariableA);
           var someVariableA;

           //Hoisting
           var car = 'maruthi';

           //in this document we do have reference or declared the name variable, let's it
           //but there is no reference / undefined error. The output is a null empty value
           console.log('My name is: ' + name);
