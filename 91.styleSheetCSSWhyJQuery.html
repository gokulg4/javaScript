<!--03. Create the Style-->
<style>        

   /* this will make all the 5 div's in the html document with red border
       here we did not specify which div, the representation is common hence the style
       is applied to all the div's in the html document */

   /* div { border: solid 1px red; } */

   /* lets assume a scenarion where we need the style to be applied 
       only for the first and the last div in the html document */

   /* div:first-child { border: solid 1px red; } */
   /* div:last-child { border: solid 1px red; } */
   /* above two CSS styles are not working */

   /* in the above cases it was easy to identify the first and last element of the 
       html document. Assume a scenario we need to target the 3rd div. In CSS implementing  
       this is very hard and huge lines of code */
   /* div:nth-child(2) { border: solid 1px red; } */

   /* : (dot) . represents the class and (hash) # represents the id all the above 
       conditions are independent of name but the below is name specific */
   div.third { border: sold 1px red; }

   /* now comes the real scenario, if we need to replace the text in 
       second div -- div2. With css it is not possible. CSS scope is only to design the document
       and not to modify a document (we can add design to a document but not modify the document)
       For modifying the document we have javascript
      they why jQuery, in javascript if we write 10 lines with jQuery the same can be 
       achieved in 1 line */
